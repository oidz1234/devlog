Devlog:
* Rss :)
* Added sparkline chart, it graphs from the start of this year to the end which is why it is very empty atm
* I'm now using the below function to edit my dev log, prev alias was not going back to orignal working dir

```
edl() {
    local OLD_DIR="$PWD"  # Save the current directory
    cd ~/Documents/dev/devlog/ || return
    vim devlog.txt
    git commit -am "Updated devlog" && git push
    cd "$OLD_DIR" || return  # Always return to the original directory
}
```

Website:
* Added a pub date to my blogs rss feed. Surprised to not have had this already to be honest.

Monitor Monkey:
* Still waiting on payments :(
* Added readme to agent with very basic install instructions
* During autoconfig the agent now ignores snap and fuse based disks/filesystems
* added new images onto homepage to new padding
